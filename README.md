# TurtleSqlClient

**TurtleSqlClient** is a lightweight data access library that supports the latest features that are available in SQL Server and Azure SQL Database.

Functions in this library use standard ADO.NET classes such as `DataReader` and `SqlCommand`. There are no constraints in the term of support of the latest SQL features. Any feature that can be used with Transact-SQL can be used with this library.
